\section{Project Description}

The system is designed for a company that provides
logistics (delivery of products to its client), product management (crud operations), and effective communication with their worker, clients, and vendors.
 
The company has its office, warehouse, and rider. 
It has a different contract with multiple firms to take the shipment from the vendors and store it in dedicated warehouses. The rider will take orders from the shopkeeper. Their order is received at the office, and the office will create the feasibility report according to their shopkeepers' needs and instructions generated for their warehouse manager to fulfill their order. The area-specific rider will receive an email about their order. The office will send a confirmation email to their shopkeeper. 
 
There are a total of four actors in the system and two stakeholders. Their titles and roles are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ CEO:} The company's owner manages all the operations.
\item \textbf{Employee:} They are assistants to CEO to help in company operations. 
\item \textbf{Warehouse Manager:} Received the instructions from the employee and ready the shipment for the rider, and managed other expenses.
\item \textbf{Rider:} They take orders from different shopkeepers and deliver the product according to pre-subscribed routes defined by the system.
\end{itemize}
The stakeholder is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Shopkeepers:} Getting the goods and services from the company.
\item \textbf{Vendor:} The vendor will provide the products to the company. 
\end{itemize}
This system is designed for one company and one CEO. CEO will be provided with already defined credentials. The CEO is responsible for creating accounts for all others actors. The CEO will provide a credential to the actors, and they will be able to update their credentials. 
 
The first dedicated dashboard for the CEO, where they monitor all operations. The operations manage their workers, products, and expenses and send emails. The CEO is the only person in the system with access to all operations. CEO analyzes company operations, including the performance of their workers and inventory. The system will present the company expenditure report.
 
The second dashboard is for office employees. They have access to manage emails, shopkeepers' orders, vendors' shipments, and company expenses. The company's expenses are the CEO, rider, and warehouse salaries. The system will present the report of payment to the vendor and shopkeeper. An employee will enter all the shipments that the company receives. They add product identifiers.
 
The third dashboard is for the warehouse manager, who receives feasibility reports of office employees and prepares the order for the rider. The warehouse manager must record the labor used in preparing the order. It could provide the miscellaneous expenses of the warehouse, like electricity costs, etc. They can view the product and make suitable changes according to the requirements.
 
The fourth dashboard is for a rider, which is basically the communicator between the company and the shopkeeper.
The rider is responsible for taking orders from the shopkeeper. 
Enter order details into the system. 
The riders will check the current orders assigned to them by the company. They will pick up the shipment from the warehouse and delivery them to the shopkeeper. The system will present the routes to the destination with the order detail. The rider received a specific amount of fuel to perform the operations. The prescribed fuel is calculated according to the formula. They can see all the products. The product will be sorted in any order. Search for a specific product from a wide range of available products. The system will deploy different sharp algorithms to access the desired date orders quickly. Able to place the order and view the detail of the order as well. 
 
The system will present the report to the CEO according to the performance of their workers, expenditures, sales and profit, salaries, inventory report, riders' performance, shopkeeper and vendor payment, workers' report, individual warehouse report, and miscellaneous expenses.
Like how many products are received in the warehouse, how many products are left, how many products are delivered to company clients, how many riders have done shipments, which rider performs most shipments, and which rider needs to perform better. It also includes how many orders a shopkeeper placed and whether the company received the payment. 
 
The email notification mechanism is embedded in the system, which helps the company communicate within and outside with other vendors and shopkeepers. After the rider has confirmed the order, the system will send an email to the company. The company will send the order details to the warehouse manager to prepare the shipment for the rider. The rider also received the email for the delivery of the order. The employee emails the CEO for any need of assistance with an issue. The warehouse manager and rider also mail to the company office for any assistance. In external communication, the client will receive a confirmation email from the system about their order. They also take assistance from the company with any issue. 
 
All the data is stored in an effective data structure to extract the data according to the need of the system actor and stakeholder.
